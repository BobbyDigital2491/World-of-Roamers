          <p className='text-white text-lg'>Trinicia “TJ” Jackson is a Licensed Professional Counselor/ Supervisor Candidate
                (LPC/S-Candidate) in Columbia, SC. I graduated from Webster University with my Masters of Arts degree
                in Clinical Mental Health Counseling. With my experiences in the human service field, I have worked
                with a multitude of diverse populations ranging from ages 2-70. I enjoy working with individuals,
                couples, and families.</p>
                <br/>
          <p className='text-white text-lg'>My passion is seeing individuals establish and restore healthy lives and relationships so that they may
                live completely whole! I do this through a variety of approaches as I am holistic. This means I am looking
                at all aspects of your life: mind, body, and spirit. Being eclectic, I use an integrative approach to the
                counseling process including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT),
                Art therapy, and other evidence-based approaches. My background has afforded me the opportunities
                to help those with mental health issues ranging from but not limited to anxiety, anger, depression,
                behavioral issues, relational issues, parenting, and trauma.</p>
                <br/>
                <p className='text-white text-lg'>I offer a safe and supportive environment, while also providing direct feedback and ideas that may
                challenge a thought or belief that may pose as a barrier toward treatment progress. During this journey,
                I am just the liaison to a better, healthier you. I would be honored to collaborate with you on your path
                to healing. Upon our initial engagement, you will be seen in a safe and secure office setting and we will
                build a rapport by discussing your history and present concerns. My schedule is open to meet your
                needs by appointment only. I look forward to working with you.</p>
